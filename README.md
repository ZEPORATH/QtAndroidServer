# QtAndroidServer

<p>
  This is a very basic QWebSocket server implementation which has a UI to interact, and successfully runs for android. 
  It is for my learning purpose. I tested this application on onePlus3, and it works fine.
  I am trying to develop some native streaming server application targetted on android but written in Qt. :)
  
  I welcome your suggestion, and feedback.
